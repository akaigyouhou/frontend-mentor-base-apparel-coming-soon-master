## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

- The main problem here is the different behavior in input between chrome and firefox. In firfox the input seems does not enlarge to the parent element thought I use absolute position with top/right/left/bottom set to 0. After set the width of input to 100%. The result seems ok.
